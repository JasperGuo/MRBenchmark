### Reference for Logical Forms

1. Expanding the Scope of the ATIS Task: The ATIS-3 Corpus
2. SQL: Learning a Neural Semantic Parser with User Feedback (https://github.com/sriniiyer/nl2sql)
3. Online Learning of Relaxed CCG Grammars for Parsing to Logical Form (The authors created a script to translate SQL queries to Lambda Calculus)

Commends:
1. SQL is labelled extremely inconsistent (monday - daynunmber, early -> [(0, 800), (0, 1000)], tomorrow -> [05/20,03/27]) (which makes the model really hard to learn)
2. Lambda Calculus is labelled more consistently, but it takes great efforts to implement an efficient interpreter.
